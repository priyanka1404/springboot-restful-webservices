to convert jpa to dto object and vice versa ,we are using two static methods(UserMapper.java)
 it is not good suggestion to use these static methods when we have more number of  entities
 here we are using model mapper library  or mapstruct library to convert jpa ->dto and vice versa


# model mapper  library

spring boot follow three layer architecture

postman---|dto|-->controller------>service->|jpa <-->dto                 |->repository-> db
                                            ----------------------------

//Development steps
1) Add ModelMapper maven dependency
2)configure ModelMapper class as spring bean
3)inject use ModelMapper spring bean in service class
