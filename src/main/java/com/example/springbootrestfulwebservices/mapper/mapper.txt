to convert jpa to dto object and vice versa ,we are using two static methods(UserMapper.java)
 it is not good suggestion to use these static methods when we have more number of  entities
 here we are using model mapper library  or mapstruct library to convert jpa ->dto and vice versa


# model mapper  library

spring boot follow three layer architecture

//Development steps
1) Add ModelMapper maven dependency
2)configure ModelMapper class as spring bean
3)inject use ModelMapper spring bean in service class


// map struct library 
//development steps 

1)add map struct maven dependency
2)create UserMapper using mapstruct
3)User UserMapper in Userserviceimpl class


1)we need to add map struct dependency from official site
and properties

2)map struct processor pligin -> compiler plugin and map struct processor 
inorder to support lombook libaray with map struct 

add plugins 
1)mapstruct processor
2)lombook
3)lombook -mapstruct-binding
