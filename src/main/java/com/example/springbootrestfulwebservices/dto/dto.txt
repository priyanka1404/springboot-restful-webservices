Data transfer object is a pattern
which  used to transfer data between client and sserver
client<---------------------------------------------------------DTo------------------------>server

|                                                                                             |
v                                                                                            v
creates dto object and send through http request.               server eill extarct dto objetcs and  and sends the http response.

//we will create the dto class ,which holds the objects of all entitys 

for example: employe management system
it contains organization entitys,department entity, employee entity 
// instead of calling them separetly ,we will use DTO which hold all these three entitys objects together

advantages:
 
> to reduce the number of remote calls
> server can use DTO to tansfer only required amount of data
> if we ues JPA instead of DTO,IT CANT HANDLE SECURITY INFO

JPA is used to store and retrive data wrspct to db
